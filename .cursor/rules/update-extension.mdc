# Update extension

## Another entry (entrypoint)

When you are asked to add a new entry or entrypoint to an existing extension, you must:

- Always create a new entrypoint file (e.g., `new-feature.ts`) in the extension's `src/` directory.
- Create a corresponding Vue component file (e.g., `NewFeature.vue`) and any required supporting files (such as assets, composables, or helpers) in appropriate subdirectories under `src/`.
- Ensure the new entrypoint is registered in the extension's `manifest.json` if required by the platform.
- Ensure the new entrypoint is added as build entry in `vite.config.js`. Try to keep build configs as they are.
- Do not merge new functionality into an existing entrypoint unless explicitly requested.
- All new files should be placed relative to the extension's main directory (e.g., `src/extension-name/`).
- Follow the established directory structure as seen in other extensions (see [macro-tracker](mdc:src/macro-tracker) for an example).
- Do not change other configs unless it is just a naming correction or explicitly mentioned

This ensures each entrypoint is modular, maintainable, and can be independently mounted or referenced by the platform.
